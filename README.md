# Finboost — Trading Bot Starter Kit

This repository is a starter template for **Finboost**, a multi-pair, 5-minute scalping trading bot.
It includes code skeletons for:
- data fetching (`fetcher.py`)
- feature engineering (`feature_engineering.py`)
- model training (`model_training.py`)
- backtesting (`backtest.py`)
- live execution wrapper (`run_bot.py`)
- logging and utilities (`utils/`)

**Important:** This is a template to get you started. You must:
- install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- provide API keys and broker credentials in `configs/settings.json`
- thoroughly test in paper/demo environments before live trading
- extend and harden error handling, risk management, and execution layers
